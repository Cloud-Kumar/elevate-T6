## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/cloud-kumar/elevate-T4.git](https://github.com/cloud-kumar/elevate-T4.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file should contain the project's dependencies.
    ```
    # requirements.txt
    Flask
    ```
    Install it using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
    Or run the Python script directly:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the website in action.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

-   The **Home Page** is accessible at the root URL (`/`). You can scroll to different sections or use the navigation links.
-   The **Contact Page** is at the `/contact` route.
-   When a user fills out the contact form and clicks "Send Message", the form data is sent via a `POST` request to the `/contact` endpoint.
-   The Flask backend in `app.py` receives this data and prints it to the console. In a production environment, this logic would be replaced with a function to send an email or save the message to a database.
-   The user is then shown a success message on the same page.
